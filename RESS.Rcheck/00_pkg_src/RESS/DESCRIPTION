Description: Contains three functions that query AuriQ Systems' Essentia Database and return the results in R. 'essQuery' takes a single Essentia command and captures the output in R, where you can save the output to a dataframe or stream it directly into additional analysis. 'read.essentia' takes an Essentia script and captures the output csv data into R, where you can save the output to a dataframe or stream it directly into additional analysis. 'capture.essentia' takes a file containing any number of Essentia commands and captures the output of the specified statements into R dataframes. Essentia can be downloaded for free at http://www.auriq.com/documentation/source/install/index.html.
